                  Hello! I'm Osama Ehsan Qureshi, a passionate Full Stack Developer with over 6 years of experience in crafting robust and scalable web applications. Born and raised in Islamabad, Pakistan, I've always been fascinated by technology and how it can solve real-world problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My journey in tech began with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from COMSATS University, Islamabad. After graduation, I started my career as a Network Operations Center Engineer at Nokia for the Telenor Pakistan Project, where I gained valuable experience in monitoring and troubleshooting network issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Transitioning into software development, I've worked with various companies, including iPlex, Total Info-Tech, and currently as a Senior Software Engineer and Team Lead at Sarmaaya Financials. Throughout my career, I've developed expertise in the MERN stack, NextJS, NestJS, SQL databases, and Golang.
